 Machine learning with wine dataset
 
 Brief Introdution about this model building project
 
What factors determine the quality of white wine originating from Portugal, also known as
Vinho Verde? During this project, we attempted to find the best machine learning model to
predict whether white wine is above the median quality or not. We used a data set that has
many different statistics about each wine, as well as the quality of the wine. From this, we
attempted to use the data to predict whether or not the wine is above the median quality or
not. To do this we use 4 different machine learning methods: K nearest neighbors, logistic
regression, classification tree, and random forest. Once we build the model we will evaluate
each model using a test set, as well as 10-fold cross-validation to then find a final model
that best predicts if white wine is above the median quality or not.
